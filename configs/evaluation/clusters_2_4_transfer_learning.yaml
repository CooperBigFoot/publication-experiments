# Clusters 2&4 Transfer Learning Evaluation Configuration
# Evaluation on similar basins (clusters 2&4) from CARAVAN dataset
#
# Note: Training configuration (features, sequences, pipeline) is automatically
# loaded from the model config files referenced in the experiment YAML.

data:
  # Path to evaluation dataset (must contain /test subdirectory)
  base_path: ../publication_data_transformed/caravan

  # Basin selection for evaluation
  gauge_ids_file: configs/basin_ids_files/clusters_2_4_basin_ids.txt

  # Pipeline for inverse transform (uses same pipeline as training)
  pipeline_path: ../publication_data_transformed/caravan/ts_pipeline.joblib
