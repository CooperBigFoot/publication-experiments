# Tajikistan Zero-Shot Transfer Evaluation Configuration
# Evaluation of pretrained models (from natural basins or clusters 2&4) on Tajikistan basins
# This measures zero-shot transfer performance before finetuning
#
# Note: Training configuration (features, sequences) is automatically loaded from
# the pretrained model checkpoints. The pipeline from the target domain is used
# for inverse transform.

data:
  # Path to evaluation dataset (must contain /test subdirectory)
  base_path: ../publication_data_transformed/central_asia

  # Basin selection for evaluation (Tajikistan basins)
  gauge_ids_file: configs/basin_ids_files/tajikistan_basins.txt

  # Pipeline for inverse transform (uses Central Asia pipeline for target domain)
  pipeline_path: ../publication_data_transformed/central_asia/ts_pipeline.joblib
