# Swiss (CAMELS_CH) Zero-Shot Transfer Evaluation Configuration
# Evaluation of TFT model trained on Swiss data
# Tests model performance on held-out Swiss basins (test split)
#
# Note: Training configuration (features, sequences) is automatically loaded from
# the model checkpoint. The pipeline from the Swiss data is used for inverse transform.

data:
  # Path to evaluation dataset (must contain /test subdirectory)
  base_path: ../CAMELS_CH_TRANSFORMED

  # Basin selection for evaluation (all Swiss basins)
  region: camelsch

  # Pipeline for inverse transform (uses Swiss pipeline)
  pipeline_path: ../CAMELS_CH_TRANSFORMED/ts_pipeline.joblib
